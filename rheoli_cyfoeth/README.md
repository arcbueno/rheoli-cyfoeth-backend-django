# Rheoli Cyfoeth

This project is a simple implementation of a REST API made in Django for the purpose of learning the framework and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. 

The Django framework is very tricky to understand because it has a lot of "under the hood" features that I am not used to. My objective is understand this features and use it as I want. 
> It is expected that some views, controllers and other classes will not be following a pattern, this project is a document for myself to use in future projects.

#### About Django and MVC

Django is a powerful web framework written in Python that follows the MVC architectural pattern. It provides a convenient way to build web applications by abstracting away common tasks, such as database management, URL routing, and form handling.

The Model-View-Controller pattern separates the application logic into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It interacts with the database and performs operations such as data retrieval, manipulation, and validation.

- **View**: Handles the presentation logic and renders the data to the user. It receives user input and communicates with the model to retrieve the necessary data.

- **Controller**: Acts as the intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, processes it, and updates the model or view accordingly.

Of course, as a study project, it means that at final moment I can affirm that the MVC pattern is not useful for developing a Django application, but I want to simulate what is a big django project in a company. 

The project name itself means "Wealth Management" in Gaelic, pretty not creative I admit.

Thank you
